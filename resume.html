                                Her eagerness to learn and apply skills showed everyday, and I'd be happy to
                                recommend her as she moves forward.</p>

                                    chapter at California State University, Fullerton. From the moment I met her, it was
                                    clear
                                    that she was a natural leader, always taking charge and coming up with innovative

                                    One of the things that impressed me the most was Tina's ability to learn new and

                                    skills, whether it was in building a business or developing technical expertise. Her

                                    inspiring.

                                    asset for any team. Her ability to inspire and motivate those around her is truly
                                    remarkable, and she has a talent for bringing out the best in everyone.

                                    <p>Tina is such a delight to work with. She is both patient and driven, so she is
                                        able to solve hard problems while not getting frustrated at the little mistakes
                                        we make along the way. Working with Tina has allowed me to learn so much more
                                        than I would have on my own or with a different pair programming partner. She is
                                        also very good at bringing out the best in you. If you want to keep up with her,

                                        I have seen some really impressive projects from Tina and love playing her
                                        minesweeper game! She definitely spends the time to learn about the subject
                                        matter and then does an excellent job applying the learnings she gets from her
                                        research. Tina's potential is uncapped and she is going to do amazing things as
                                        a software engineer for whoever is lucky enough to hire her.
