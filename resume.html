                <p>I had the pleasure of working with Tina at Brainstorm. I witnessed her positive
                    and creative approach to solving problems, and the way she took direction well.
                    Her eagerness to learn and apply skills showed everyday, and I'd be happy to
                    recommend her as she moves forward.</p>

                <p>I had the pleasure of getting to know her through Theta Tau, a professional engineering chapter at   California State University, Fullerton. From the moment I met her, it was clear that she was a natural leader, always taking charge and coming up with innovative ideas even in the toughest of situations.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the things that impressed me the most was Tina's ability to learn new and
                    relevant skills, whether it was in building a business or developing technical expertise. Her
                    dedication and drive to continuously improve herself and her team was truly inspiring.
                    <br><br>
                    I can say with confidence that Tina's leadership qualities and work ethic are an
                    invaluable asset for any team. Her ability to inspire and motivate those around her is truly
                    remarkable, and she has a talent for bringing out the best in everyone.

                <p>I worked with Tina at BrainStorm Education and discovered that she is a dedicated,
                    ambitious,
                    and hard-working person. While we did not work on the same team, her effort and the
                    quality
                    of her work was clear where our areas overlapped.</p>

                <p>Tina is such a delight to work with. She is both patient and driven, so she is
                    able to solve hard problems while not getting frustrated at the little mistakes
                    we make along the way. Working with Tina has allowed me to learn so much more
                    than I would have on my own or with a different pair programming partner. She is
                    also very good at bringing out the best in you. If you want to keep up with her,
                    then you better not slack off or you will get left in a cloud of dust!
                    <br><br>
                    I have seen some really impressive projects from Tina and love playing her
                    minesweeper game! She definitely spends the time to learn about the subject
                    matter and then does an excellent job applying the learnings she gets from her
                    research. Tina's potential is uncapped and she is going to do amazing things as
                    a software engineer for whoever is lucky enough to hire her.

                <p>Tina is one of the hardest working and most determined people I have had the
                    pleasure of working with. Coming from next to no experience she has become an
                    excellent and skilled developer. Her best works are found on her personal
                    portfolio site which coincidentally is her most forward facing and impressive
                    project in my opinion. She is hard working and, as clearly described by her
                    projects, very self determined and capable of learning new technologies on the
                    fly no matter what the obstacle. Any team would be lucky to have a dependable
                    and ingenuitive developer like Tina on their team </p>

                    that programming is her first passion and I'm eager to lean of her professional
